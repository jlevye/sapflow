Conductivity calcs

Dh = Carboy ht - balance ht
Plant conductivity = =(flow*(length/100))/(Dh*10)
Ks = Plant conductivity/Sapwood area 
LSC = Plant conductivity/ leaf area
Huber value = Sapwood area/leaf area

Units?
Water potential = MPa I assume (ranges 2-16ish)
Leaf area = cm^2
Length = cm
Din and Dout = mm? um? cm if actually DBHish? 
Sapwood area = pi*((Dout/60)/2)^2- pi*((Dout/60)/2)^2
 -why divide by 60? where's that coming from 
K: kg m-1 s-1 Mpa-1
LSC: g m-1 s-1 MPa-1

ADD back in max height information - to calculate PLC
